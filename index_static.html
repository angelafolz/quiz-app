				<p class="information">Black holes, contrary to their common image, have the same gravitational effects as any other equal mass in their place. They will draw objects nearby towards them, just as any other planetary body does, except at very close distances. If, for example, the Sun were replaced by a black hole of equal mass, the orbits of the planets would be essentially unaffected. A black hole can act like a &ldquo;cosmic vacuum cleaner&rdquo; and pull a substantial inflow of matter, but only if the star it forms from is already having a similar effect on surrounding matter. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions#Astronomy" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
